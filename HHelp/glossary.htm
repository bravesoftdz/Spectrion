<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Measurement
device</i> – external device which is presented as Delphi frame in the program 
and communicate through standard set of commands with interpreter. Only for 
measurement purposes. Two types – <font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter">2D (or 
serial mode) and 3D (or package mode)</font>, as in multi channel ADC card vs 
oscilloscope. Names – three characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter">2D (or serial 
mode)</font><i>
measurement device</i>
– offers separate channels (one or more). Typically – ADC card or one channel of 
oscilloscope. Each ADC
/measurement channel is responsible for different external parameter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>3D
measurement device</i> – offers an array of values which can be proceed as 
ensemble. 3D type of multi-channel device means that you can have
more than one spectrum at one shot (e.g. different channels of the
oscilloscope).</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Control
device</i> – offers
typically one channel; optionally multi-channels control over some external
parameter(s). Calibration for using absolute and relative units can be set.
Names – three letters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Synchronisation
(sinchro) device</i> –
all the measurements are synchronised optionally with this device. Could be used
for temporally pause or abort of measurement sequence (scanning). Reserved
script name -<b>&quot;Snh&quot;</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Interpreter</i>
– part of the program, which interprets the script, commands coming from the 
procedures or elsewhere, call the respective device functions and send back the 
result. For general commands - reserved script name <b>&quot;Itr&quot;</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>Procedures</i>
– usually dialog boxes with options for later execution of sequences of
commands to the devices with results typically presented in <i>TheoPlot</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i>TheoPlot</i>
– chart component presenting GC/MS or MS, with some options for data processing.</p>
