<h3><b>Run menu (procedures)</b></h3>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">Autotune</span></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><span style="font-size: 9pt">Before you start your measurements you probably would like to estimate the 
quality of your signal and optimize it along the way. </span> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This procedure will optimize/find your signal using three different methods 
depending on the initial conditions (do you have a signal and if you do how 
good?).</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">Simple scan</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to measure your signal (serial mode) as a function of one 
parameter (or time) here is the place to go.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">Uni-scan</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case you need more complicated measurements as measuring the one or two 
signals as function of 0, 1 or 2 parameters (control device channels) use uni-scan. 
The versatility of the procedure will fit most of your scanning needs.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">PCA classification</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you need to classify your samples by their mass spectra against a training 
set (created in PCA detective - included here). The classification type is 
one-class classifier (the unknown is tested against each class consecutively) 
and the method is Principal Component Analysis / Mahalanobis Distance.</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">The procedures are complemented by two <b>utilities</b> which are simplified 
scans and are attached to two button on the main tool bar. See options to how 
set measuring devices for them. </span> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">These two utilities are:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oscilo</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt"> - simulating oscilloscope showing in high 
speed spectra from measurement device in package mode.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquire</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt"> - similar to Oscilo but keeping the signal 
in memory, show it as GC/MS and offer a possibility to save it later.</span></p>
