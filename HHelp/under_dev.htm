<h3>Under development</h3>
<hr size="1">
<p>The Spectrion project is under development, no promises about any of the 
planned tasks deadlines (in some cases I really have no idea). </p>
<p>I would appreciate any involvement from your part: coding, advice, or just an 
opinion. </p>
<p>Using Spectrion or any part of it is allowed for any purposes (commercial or 
non-commercial), just give me some credit in your about box &amp; help and let me know at
<a href="http://sicyon.com/spectrion">http://sicyon.com/spectrion</a> and click 
on my name at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>The development is going in a few directions:</p>
<p>1. Multitasking. The present implementation of multitasking is far from 
optimal, there is no proper multithreading, just workaround. So next task in 
that direction would be to implement view-model-controller design pattern with 
proper multithreading.</p>
<p>2. TheoPlot:</p>
<ul>
	<li>TheoPlot is accepting limited number of file formats and the most 
	popular one (mzML) is on the dev pipe-line. Next step would be to integrate MS 
	file format converter from any file format to mzML. </li>
	<li>Next would be to make both panes (Chrom and Mass) to accept many series 
	- in three modes (1) one chart - many series (2) multi-tabs, one 
	chart/series per tab (3) stacked (piled) charts one series per chart. </li>
	<li>New filters and peaking methods including ones taking into an account 
	the whole 3D picture (GC/MS). </li>
	<li>Extract and save a subset of GC/MS by ret.time and/or mass ranges.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Develop utilities plug-in system, as Oscilo and Aqcuire but extendable and 
dynamic. Small plug-ins into Uni-scan for extracting on fly of spectrum meta 
parameter (as certain peak width) and put it into another plot.</p>
<p>4. New procedures, like: </p>
<ul>
	<li>GC/MS deconvolution </li>
	<li>improving on autotune by using some modern algorithms of collective 
	intelligence like PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)</li>
</ul>

<p>...feel free to send me your development suggestions. </p>
