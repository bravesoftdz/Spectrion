<strong>The device rack</strong>
</h3>
<hr size="1">
<p><img border="0" src="images/dvc_rack.gif" align="right" hspace="7">The devices rack is lowest
(deepest) layer from the final (graphical) presentation point of view. This
layer is shown on the right of your screen where each virtual device is presented as
separated &quot;child&quot; window into the device container window (device
rack). The user can control each device manually and see the results from
measurements. There are three types of devices –
measurement (MD), control (CD) and synchro types. Synchro (short from
synchronization) device is only one, but another two types could be as many as
needed. One could say that measurement device is input device and control
device is output one and that would be no far from the truth (see Glossary for
definitions). Each type provides standard set of commands called by the
interpreter. Your real (external) devices are presented by these
&quot;logical&quot; devices the same way as in &quot;good old&quot; DOS you can
assign a directory to logical drive. One real device could be presented by more
than one logical device. If the external device is really complex and has both
measurement and control functions, the only way to &quot;plug&quot; it into the
Spectrion is to present it as two logical devices - one for the control functions and
one for measurement ones. Each logical device (device for short) is presented in
Spectrion in two ways. First way is visual, in separate window (form in Delphi) with
visual components, which represent different device features. There, the user
can operate manually with these features, setting for example the most
appropriate parameters for the next measurement. </o:p>
</p>
<p>Each device has in four states: <o:p>
 </o:p>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>off-line
(white-cream banner) – before initialization<o:p> </o:p>(connection)</li>
	<li>standby (grey
banner) – after initialization, but not running yet</li>
	<li>running (teal
banner) – working state</li>
	<li>warning (yellow
banner)– as running but with warning that one or more of controlled parameter
are out of range.</li>
	<li>danger - the device goes
in standby state due to a dangerous conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand better what
measurement or control devices are follow the three lists of commands which
define internal interface between interpreter and device in Appendix B.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</p>
<p>Each device has three pages
(tabs) –<o:p>
 </o:p>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: 700">Normal</span> page for
minimised presentation of device functionality - minimum space, without lost of
control or information.<o:p> </o:p></li>
	<li>The purpose of
<b>extended </b>page is visual comfort. Each functionality of a device is presented by full
colour visual components, for easy manipulation (e.g dials, sliders) and nicer 
signal visualization (e.g. charts, progress bars).<o:p> </o:p></li>
	<li>Third page
is for opening/saving or some adjustments of the
device <b>setting</b>. Each saved device setting file has an extension of the 
	device name (three charatcters). When initialized the device (e.g. DVC) 
	would look for Defaults.DVC file to load its setting from.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the top of device rack 
there are some buttons to operate it. The green long button on the right is the main switch (of 
the device rack). On the left next is lock/unlock button to enable/disable user control to 
the devices, next two buttons are for loading/saving the device rack setting 
(complete set of all devices settings), and the last three buttons allows the user to turn 
all the device pages simultaneously.</p>
<p>There are two modes of
synchronization synchro mode and asynchro mode. In the synchro mode the pointer
of the data buffer is transferred into the measurement device and then that
device is taking care for synchronization – usually immediately after the
measurement is done the buffer is updated. That is so called Data stream mode,
(fastest possible) with sacrifice of control – nothing else could be changed
synchronically. Visually it is presented by redish small panel under the synchro
device. In asynchro mode the synchronization of the measurement is done by
synchro device, each time the measurement needs synchronization the procedure
takes it from there. The possible ways to synchronization are: by button, delay
or external event.</p>
