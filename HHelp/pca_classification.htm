<h3><b>PCA classification</b></h3>
<hr size="1">

<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">
<img border="1" src="images/PCAproc.gif" align="right" hspace="7">If you need to classify your samples by their mass spectra against a training 
set (created in PCA detective - included here). The classification type is 
one-class classifier (the unknown is tested against each class consecutively) 
and the method is Principal Component Analysis / Mahalanobis Distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">
PCA detective</span> is a freeware chemometrics software for classification of 
substances using their mass-spectra. The used multivariate analysis is based on 
Principal Component Analysis with Mahalanobis Distance (PCA-MD) and it is of one 
class classifier category. PCA detective has been tested using mass-spectra, but 
there is no limitation to be used with any other kind of characteristic spectra 
(e.g. VIS, IR, NMR). The only twist is to find appropriate channel (bin) size, 
which in case of mass-spec is naturally the mass number.</p>
<p>PCA detective is quick, provides variety of tools to optimize your PCA 
training and it can do classification by itself. </p>
<p>PCA detective is a nice project, but <a href="http://www.classifion.com">
Classifion</a> (freeware) is more mature product with more optimization options 
and automation.</p>
