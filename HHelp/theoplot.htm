<b>TheoPlot</b></h3>
<hr size="1">

<p>The purpose of TheoPlot is to present data in visual way and feedback information to the
procedures layer. TheoPlot provides features for visualization and some simple
data processing of the data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TheoPlot
has two panels, top one for TIC (total ion current) chromatographic data&nbsp; and
bottom one for MS (mass-spectrum) spectrum they both have similar control. The
three long button on the right side are for opening additional tabbed menus for
Chrom, Mass or common. If the user presses Chrom or Mass Button with the right
mouse button the respective panel becomes hidden, but all the data are intact.</p>
<p>The principal features
are available through the toolbar on the left and include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<span style="font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span>Unzoom button –
retrieve full view of the spectrum<o:p> </o:p></li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span>AutoY – if on,
when the user zoom the Y scale is adjusted automatically.<o:p> </o:p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:normal; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span>Zoom – Zoom and
Range to button are alternative. Zoom mode is for zooming the spectrum by press
and drop mouse routine. With the right mouse user can move the spec by
drag&amp;drop.</li>
	<li>The range mode allows the user to select one or more
regions (ranges) which will be presented in the other panel. When the user press
the left mouse button and drag along the spec the respective area is selected.
If user press and release the left mouse button, only single mass is selected,
if during single mass selection the user hold Shift button the value under round
green marker is selected. If the user double click within a peak the whole peak
is selected. If the user hold Ctrl button when selected the new range list is
set (the old one is deleted).</li>
	<li>Table button –
shows the values of the spectrum (and peaks if the option is on) in a table(s)<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span>,
On the top of the&nbsp;tables there are two pairs of buttons for saving / 
copying tables in file / clipboard.
</li>
	<li>Smoothing button
provides smoothing of the spectrum with desired factor.<o:p>
Standard method is similar to that used in GRAMS, first derivative method is 
fast and versatile, but gives no peak boundaries, the last one (adaptive) 
readjust peaking by the mass scale.&nbsp;
</o:p></li>
	<li>Baseline
correction subtracts a baseline replacing the value under the threshold with
value 1. 
	<o:p>The auto option is trying to calculate the baseline level using simplified GIFTS 
algorithm (linear, two-steps)
</o:p></li>
	<li>Peaking button
labels the peak value of the spectrum; there are three different modes of
peaking – standard (similar to GRAMS), first derivative and adaptive. The last one
is adaptive to the X-scale of the chart and shows different number of peak when
the user zooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can adjust range,
smoothing, baseline and peaking parameters from a secondary tabbed panel which
appears when the right long button is pressed. Any change of any parameter is
immediately takes effect, so the user can adjust them following the changes they
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;The tabbed options on the right
appear when the user&nbsp;presses </span>
smoothing, baseline or peaking with the right mouse button.</p>

<p>TheoPlot component
is based on
